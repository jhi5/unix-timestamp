This is a microservice that takes a date string and serves back JSON data of the Unix and Standard values of the given date.

Part of a series of small API tools created as a way to teach myself API basics.

This project was created as part of a FreeCodeCamp program and to meet the following deliverables:

* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

TO-DO: Write documentation within the code.
